# euler
My take on [Project Euler problems][1].

I'm feeding an [Euler class][3] with one method per problem. Each method will have the code needed to solve the problem.
I'm using [PHP Reflection classes][2] to list each problem and their descriptions (which are taken from each method comment).

> Note: Some problems changed since I solved them back in 2010 - there might be some differences.
